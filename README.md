About Me

I'm an AI Engineer with over 4+ years of experience in developing advanced deep learning models tailored for medical imaging and its analysis. My work has contributed to FDA-cleared solutions and enhancing clinical outcomes. I specialize in creating efficient deep-learning pipelines while maintaining compliance with FDA & HIPAA regulations.

### Areas of Expertise
- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, MONAI
- **Medical Imaging**: DICOM, NIfTI, 3D Slicer
- **Cloud & DevOps**: AWS (S3, EC2, ECR), Docker
- **Data Science**: Python, SQL, Pandas, Scikit-Learn
- **Algorithms**: Segmentation, Classification, Clustering

## Featured Projects:
### 1. **Breast DCE-MRI Segmentation [FDA-Cleared - #K231130]**
- Developed a multi-label segmentation algorithm for Breast DCE-MRI that achieved FDA 510k clearance.
- Improved clinical performance by 15% and reduced catastrophic failures by 95%.
- Automated the training and evaluation pipeline using Docker and AWS EC2/ECS.
- Implemented SAM-like Data-flywheel to scale the data generation.

### 2. **Benchamrking 3D Segmentation competitions in under $50**
- Working on nn-UNet-esque customizable segmentation pipeline to develop and test off-the-shelf segmentation models with minimal intervention.
- Create end-to-end pipeline that delivers a dockerized version of the best model along with a model-card.

### 3. **COVID Detection and Severity Assessment**
- Created a pipeline using DenseNet variants for detecting COVID-19 and assessing severity from CXR images.
- Enhanced model robustness against adversarial examples and data noise.
